shoreleave
==========

A smarter client-side in ClojureScript

###Shoreleave is a collection of integrated libraries that focuses on:

 * Security
 * Idiomatic interfaces
 * Common client-side strategies
 * HTML5 capabilities
 * ClojureScript's advantages

It builds upon efforts found in other ClojureScript projects, such as [Fetch](https://github.com/ibdknox/fetch) and [ClojureScript:One](http://clojurescriptone.com/).


Demo-shoreleave-solr Overview
------------------------
###This is a work in progress
The goal is illustrate how to build a client using partial rendering, and render search results from SOLR via JSONP calls.

You can interactively explore the code base using a [Catnip](https://github.com/bodil/catnip) guided tour: `lein2 edit`

You can also browse the [Marginalia docs](#) and run with app with: `lein run`


Libraries used
--------------
Shoreleave makes no assumptions about other libraries you might be using in your app.

This particular demo uses:

 * [Enfocus](https://github.com/ckirkendall/enfocus)
 * [jayq](https://github.com/ibdknox/jayq)


Why is there a Rakefile
------------------------
This demo is built using partial renders.  Pages are partially compiled (baked) on the server,
then DOM swaps and dynamic interactions are added with ClojureScript.

The Rakefile laces together the partial pieces of HTML into a final, servable page.
You can compile the pages with: `rake`

The client uses the partial HTML snippets to build out pieces of the DOM.
